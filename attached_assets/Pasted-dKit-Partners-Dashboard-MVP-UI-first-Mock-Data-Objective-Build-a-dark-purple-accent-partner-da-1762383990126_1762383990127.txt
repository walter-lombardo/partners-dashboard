dKit Partners Dashboard (MVP, UI-first, Mock Data)

Objective
Build a dark, purple-accent partner dashboard where projects (affiliates) can:

Sign up with email + password

Submit project details, Bitcoin payout address, and tracking IDs (THORName, MayaName, Chainflip address)

See a Dashboard with KPIs, a time-series chart, and Latest Transactions (mocked now; wire real indexers later)

Important

Follow the aesthetic of the attached screenshot exactly (sidebar left, top KPIs, purple line chart, cards, latest transactions table).

Do not include any logos—the user will upload them later.

UI/UX must be production-polished, but backend is mock (in-memory) for this MVP.

Stack & Project Layout

Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript

Styling: Tailwind CSS (dark theme), minimal custom CSS variables for gradients

UI: shadcn/ui components (Cards, Buttons, Inputs, Tabs, Select, Tooltip)

Forms: React Hook Form + Zod (client validation only)

Charts: Recharts (single area/line series with gradient fill)

API: Next Route Handlers returning mock JSON (no database)

Auth (MVP): simple email+password with in-memory store; protect /dashboard, /wallet, /settings via “isLoggedIn” flag

Branding & Visuals (match screenshot)

Background: deep charcoal gradient (top darker → bottom slightly lighter).

Surfaces: card panels with soft radii and subtle inner shadow.

Accent: bright purple for chart stroke, highlights, active nav pill.

Text: off-white for primary, cool gray for secondary.

State Icons: small green/red up/down chevrons next to % changes.

Sidebar: left vertical nav with icons & labels, active item highlighted (pill).

Header: page title “dKiT Partners Dashboard” (exact spelling) aligned to the left.

Top KPIs: two big numbers (“Total Volume” and “Affiliate Fees Earned”), each with tiny secondary line “~ 13.4578 BTC” style. Include an “eye”/“hide” icon placeholder next to each amount.

Use the attached screenshot for spacing, paddings, typography size hierarchy, and component placement.

Navigation & Pages
Sidebar items (top→bottom)

Dashboard (active on load after onboarding)

Wallet

Settings

Support

Routes

/login

Email, Password, “Sign in”

Link: “New here? Create an account” → /onboarding

/onboarding (3-step wizard)

Step 1 – Basics: Project Name, Project Logo (file picker UI only), dApp link (https://…)

Step 2 – Payouts: Bitcoin address for payouts

Helper text: “Affiliate payouts are sent to your Bitcoin address. Use a wallet you control; on-chain payments are final.”

Step 3 – Tracking IDs: THORName, MayaName, Chainflip address

Helper text: “We attribute swaps and fees to your project using these IDs.”

Buttons: Back / Continue; Finish leads to /dashboard

/dashboard

Top KPIs:

Total Volume (USD) — large numeric

Affiliate Fees Earned (USD) — large numeric

Below each, a tiny “~ 13.4578 BTC” style subline (mock conversion)

Chart block:

Title: “Market Overview”

Toggle Metric: [Fees | Volume] (default Fees)

Range tabs: 1D, 7D, 1M, 3M, All (default 1D or 7D; choose whichever matches screenshot best)

Tooltip with value + small green/red delta badge

Latest Transactions card/table:

Columns: Asset/Route, Time, Amount (+0.431 BTC style), USD notional (subtext), Status (Completed/Terminated with green/red dot)

Four example rows to mirror screenshot proportions

/wallet

Single form: Bitcoin address for payouts

Buttons: Save / Copy Address / Reveal masked address

/settings

Project: Name, Logo placeholder, dApp link

Tracking IDs: THORName, MayaName, Chainflip address

Save button; inline validation messages

/support

Short FAQ + “Contact support” mailto link (placeholder)

Form Fields, Labels & Validation

Exact labels

Project Name

Project Logo

dApp link

Bitcoin address for payouts

THORName

MayaName

Chainflip address

Validation (client-side, show inline error text)

dApp link must start with https://

Bitcoin address: allow 1…, 3…, or bc1… (basic length/pattern check; no heavy checksum now)

THORName / MayaName: lowercase letters, digits, and dashes only, 1–32 chars

Chainflip address: freeform for MVP (non-empty optional)

Masking

When displaying stored BTC address, show prefix…suffix with a Reveal button and a Copy button.

Data Model (MVP in-memory)

User: { id, email, role: "PARTNER", projectId }

Project: { id, name, logoUrl?, dappUrl, btcAddress?, thorName?, mayaName?, chainflipAddress? }

MetricPoint: { t: ISODate, volumeUsd: number, feesUsd: number, trades: number }

Transaction: { ts: ISODate, route: "BTC→ETH" | "ETH→USDC" | etc, usdNotional: number, feeUsd: number, status: "Completed"|"Terminated", txHash: string, chain: "THOR"|"MAYA"|"CHAINFLIP" }

Seed 30 days of points with mild randomness and 4–8 recent transactions so the UI looks alive.

Mock API Contract (must match exactly)

GET /api/me →

{
  "user": { "id": "u1", "email": "partner@demo.app", "role": "PARTNER", "projectId": "p1" },
  "project": {
    "id": "p1",
    "name": "Your Project",
    "logoUrl": null,
    "dappUrl": "https://example.app",
    "btcAddress": "bc1qexample...",
    "thorName": "your-thorname",
    "mayaName": "your-mayaname",
    "chainflipAddress": "0xabc...def"
  }
}


GET /api/metrics?from=&to=&granularity=day →

{
  "series": [
    { "t": "2025-10-10", "volumeUsd": 12450.12, "feesUsd": 86.44, "trades": 32 }
  ],
  "totals": {
    "volumeUsd": 345045.31,
    "feesUsd": 3450.45,
    "trades": 981,
    "change24h": 0.023,
    "btcEquivalent": 13.4578
  }
}


GET /api/transactions?limit=25 →

[
  { "ts": "2025-10-10T10:34:00Z", "route": "BTC→ETH", "usdNotional": 3489.90, "feeUsd": 12.40, "status": "Completed", "txHash": "0x...", "chain": "THOR" }
]


The UI must consume these endpoints and render without any additional configuration.

Interactions & UX

Metric toggle (Fees/Volume) switches which series the chart displays and which KPI highlights.

Range tabs (1D/7D/1M/3M/All) re-bucket series client-side (simple filter of mock data).

Tooltips: show value (e.g., $42,589.43) and a tiny delta badge +3.53 in green for positive changes.

KPIs: allow “hide/reveal” icon next to the big numbers (mask values).

Empty states:

Dashboard (no data): “We’re waiting for your first trades. Add your THOR/Maya/Chainflip IDs in Settings to start tracking.”

Wallet (no BTC): “Add a Bitcoin address to receive monthly affiliate payouts.”

Accessibility & Polish

Focus states visible against dark background.

Sufficient contrast for text and icons.

Keyboard navigation for sidebar and tabs.

Responsive: collapse sidebar to an icon rail ≤ 1024px; table scrolls horizontally if needed.

Numbers use tabular-nums for clean alignment.

Acceptance Criteria (what to verify)

You can register (mock) → complete the 3-step onboarding → land on /dashboard.

Dashboard shows: two big KPIs, chart with purple accent and gradient, metric + range toggles, Latest Transactions card with 4+ rows.

Wallet saves and displays a Bitcoin address, masked by default; Copy and Reveal work.

Settings updates Project basics and Tracking IDs; validation errors appear inline.

Support shows a minimal help page.

All content matches the look & layout of the attached screenshot (spacing, hierarchy, colors).
